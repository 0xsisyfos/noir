//! This module is an abstraction layer over `Brillig`
//! To allow for separation of concerns, it knows nothing
//! about SSA types, and can therefore be tested independently.
//! `brillig_gen` is therefore the module which combines both
//! ssa types and types in this module.
//! A similar paradigm can be seen with the `acir_ir` module.
